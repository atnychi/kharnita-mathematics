## 🧠 Overview

*Kharnita Mathematics* is a formal framework for modeling harmonic structure, liquidity dynamics, and recursive intelligence in live, time-sensitive systems. Designed for use in real-time trading, adaptive cybernetics, and autonomous systems, Kharnita Math formalizes the underlying geometry of structural emergence and systemic reversals through live bar-by-bar logic.

It introduces new constructs grounded in applied mathematics and geometric ratio modeling, including:

- **Ghost Zones** — non-local projected harmonic zones  
- **Delta Absorption Layers** — liquidity compression and pressure neutralization regions  
- **Liquidity Flip Anchors** — directional flow inversion points  
- **Bar-by-Bar Ratio Scanning** — live harmonic tracking per market interval  
- **Chrono-Inversion Nodes** — time-based decision inflection markers  

These components function as reactive, modular building blocks for precision system design in volatile, high-speed, or nonlinear domains.
