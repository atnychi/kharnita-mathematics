## 🧠 Overview

*Kharnita Mathematics* is a formal system for real-time harmonic structure modeling, built for high-performance applications in financial markets, adaptive systems, and recursive intelligence. This framework defines mathematical constructs such as:

- **Ghost Zones** — projective harmonic regions based on non-local ratio continuity  
- **Delta Absorption Layers** — zones where momentum is neutralized or flipped by liquidity pressure  
- **Liquidity Flip Anchors** — structural pivots where systemic flow direction reverses  
- **Bar-by-Bar Ratio Scanning** — live recursive analysis of market geometry at each tick  

The system does not rely on conventional technical patterns. It redefines harmonic behavior through mathematically reactive modeling that adapts to the underlying liquidity map.
