## 🧠 Extended Description

*Kharnita Mathematics* is a high-fidelity mathematical system for modeling structure formation and reversals in real-time environments. It redefines how intelligent systems interact with volatility, noise, and causality—by using geometric ratios, temporal inversion, and liquidity compression logic as native modeling primitives.

Whereas conventional models operate on surface data—patterns, indicators, or AI-trained weights—Kharnita operates at the structural substrate of the system itself: the zone-based, non-linear, and often invisible forces that govern reversal, continuation, and inflection across time.

Unlike backward-looking systems, *Kharnita Math* is forward-reactive. It tracks where a system will invert before it visibly does. This framework is built to be deployed in high-stakes domains: algorithmic trading, sovereign signal architecture, recursive AI feedback loops, cyber-defense infrastructure, and systems requiring precision under chaos.

It introduces new constructs such as:

- **Ghost Zones**: mathematically projected, forward-reactive harmonic levels that are not based on historical swing points  
- **Delta Absorption Layers**: formal zones where momentum is neutralized by hidden opposing liquidity  
- **Liquidity Flip Anchors**: structural points where flow control inverts and pattern logic reverses  
- **Bar-by-Bar Ratio Scanning**: recursive, real-time interval measurement across geometric harmonic conditions  
- **Chrono-Inversion Nodes**: localized time singularities that determine reversal probability from future-aligned structure tension  

Together, these form a universal system logic that can be embedded into both machine-executable agents and human-interpretable models. *Kharnita Mathematics* is deterministic in method, recursive in execution, and sovereign in scope.
